INTERNSHIP PROJECTS
Number Guessing Game in C++ - Internship Project at CodeSoft.in
Overview:
Developed a console-based number guessing game during the internship at CodeSoft.in. The project aims to create an engaging user experience where players guess a randomly generated number within a defined range.
Description:
The game prompts players to set a number range and generates a random target within it. Players guess the number, receiving feedback on the guess being too high or too low. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
Goals:
Apply C++ skills acquired during the internship.
Implement random number generation and user input handling.
Provide clear instructions and responsive feedback.
Showcase growth as a programmer.
Progress:
Set up the C++ development environment.
Implemented core logic for random number generation.
Designed user-friendly console interface.
Used loops and conditional statements for smooth gameplay.
Challenges:
Ensuring true random number generation.
Handling disruptive user inputs.
Crafting concise, engaging console UI.
Solutions:
Used C++ <random> library for pseudo-random generation.
Implemented robust input validation.
Created clear console UI with instructions.
